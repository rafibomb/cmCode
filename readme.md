# Project Starter Template

Welcome to my starter project template.

[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/zurb/foundation-zurb-template/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/zurb/foundation-zurb-template#info=devDependencies)

It has a Gulp-powered build system with these features:

- Handlebars HTML templates with Panini
- Sass compilation and autoprefixing
- JavaScript module bundling with webpack
- Built-in BrowserSync server
- For production builds:
  - CSS compression
  - JavaScript module bundling with webpack
  - Image compression

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 12 recommended, tested with 12.16.3)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

1. **Download or clone the template.**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rafibomb/gulp-sass-handlebars-template.git your_project_name
```

2. If you cloned, return (skip this step) :) Else if you downloaded, unzip and rename the file to your project name.

3. Then open the folder in your command line:

```bash
cd your_project_name
```

4. Install the needed dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

5. Run `yarn start` to run Gulp. Your compiled site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You're ready to go!

---

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `yarn run build`.

## Dev Dependencies

No 3rd party dependencies needed on this one.
